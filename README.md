# C Programming
Hey guys! 

![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/cdn-uploads/Clanguage-1024x341.png)

Although C programming language has become outdated now, yet some institutions prefer including the language in their curriculum as C is called "The mother of all programming languages". Most of the current trending languages are derived from C directly or indirectly. Hence, why not give it a try !

This repository is to maintain my C programming codes as well as all study materials.
Here we go!
