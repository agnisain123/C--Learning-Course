# C-Basics
Hey guys! 

This is my repository to contain my practice codes in C. The codes are more or less very simple - just to get through the syntax and features of the language. I've been using java all this time. 

Programs included :

1. Diamond Pattern Of Numbers - https://github.com/DeathNaughT-GitHub/C-Basics/blob/master/Diamond_Pattern.c

Thanks ~Ayush
